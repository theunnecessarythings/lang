- [ ] Defer
- [ ] Union
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Add Test cases from zig
- [ ] Labeled Blocks
- [ ] Dynamic Match (Check Swift)
- [ ] If guard - side effect ?
- [ ] Closure
- [ ] Errors/Results/Optionals/Try/Catch
- [ ] Disambiguating overlapping traits
- [x] Bug: Error location is not correct for imports
- [ ] Bug: I don't think comma's are correctly consumed everywhere
- [ ] Bug: Something unexpected comes, the parser loops forever
- [ ] Remote Trait Implementation/ Implicit trait conformance (Mojo duck typing)
- [ ] Multiple results from any regions/blocks
- [ ] String literals are not parsed (unescaped)
- [x] Function overloading
- [ ] Implement RAII and similar to mojo
- [ ] Pointers
- [ ] Bug: All structs are returned as values, not pointers
- [ ] Bug: Handling Path Expressions, (eg. Impl only work with a type(str), not a path)
- [x] Bug: global string constants for strings are duplicated
- [x] Change break to 'yield' in loops and blocks
- [ ] Advanced Compile Time Evaluation
  - [ ] Checking runtime dependencies
  - [ ] Comptime arguments
- [ ] Allow function declaration
- [ ] Add inlining (modify the inline interface)
- [ ] Move structs and tuple structs from LLVM to Memref
- [ ] Field Access out of bounds compile time check
- [x] MLIROp
- [ ] Delegate some analysis to analyser.cpp (now empty)
- [ ] Bug: functions and variables can have the same name
- [x] Bug: Tests are broken again (roundtrip fails because builtins are double imported)
- [ ] String Interning
- [ ] Use EmitC for codegen to C/C++
- [ ] Explore StableHLO
- [ ] Lower arrays to memrefs with alloc, will be easier to handle, then after comptime
      eval if the size is known, we can replace it with stack allocation
- [ ] Bug: Right now when generics are instantiated, the first original copy is still kept around before renaming, could pose issues.
